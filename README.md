# Dream-Dive
CO-OP Fantasy game inspired by the movie Inception.

## Overview
Dream Dive is a stealth and puzzle game based on the movie "Inception", where players take on the role of "Dream Walkers" who enter people's dreams to steal secrets or plant ideas in their subconscious. The game features multiple levels of increasing difficulty, each with a different dream and task to complete.

## Gameplay
The game requires players to navigate through the dream landscapes without alerting the dreamer or the defenses of the subconscious. Each level is more dangerous and complex than the previous one, and players must work together to make difficult decisions and solve puzzles to progress.

The players will be divided into different roles, each with its own abilities and tools that contribute to the progress and completion of the task.
## The roles
* Dream Architect: Can create and manipulate the environment of the dream, including opening hidden doors, creating stairs, and swinging objects. Special ability: creating special objects such as a trampoline or defense fortresses.

* Point Man: The navigator and leader of the team, with a "dream map" that lays out the vagrants and obstacles. Special ability: slowing down time for a short period that can be used to complete a task or for a dangerous escape.

* Chemist: Can create and deliver the sedative that puts you into a dream state, and can prepare a variety of chemical compounds for attack and distraction. Can also prepare dream potions for the crew.

* Forger: Can forge objects and areas in the environment in a dream and use this to deceive or distract the opinion of the enemies. Special ability: ability to create characters in a dream that can imitate the appearance and the behavior of enemies.

Each role will have its own special ability that can be activated by consuming a dream potion, which increases the abilities of each character.

## Teamwork and Strategy
Dream Dive requires a high level of cooperation and strategy from the players, as they must work together to utilize their strengths and overcome challenges. The team must also manage the stability of the dream to ensure they don't get lost or fall into a deeper dream state.

Players will have to make difficult and sometimes fatal decisions, such as fighting enemies or sneaking, choosing paths, and entering deeper valleys of dreams. One player will have to stay behind in each stage to wake the others before the sedation expires and they are trapped in the dream world.
